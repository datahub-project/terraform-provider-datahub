# Changelog

All notable changes to this provider will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `datahub_connection` resource: create, update, and delete DataHub Connections -- reusable, encrypted credential configurations for data platforms (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Unity Catalog) and any other platform via a generic `raw_config` escape hatch. Connection credentials are never stored in Terraform state (WriteOnly). Drift detection covers `name` and `platform` via the strongly-consistent OpenAPI v3 read path. Credential rotation is triggered by incrementing `config_wo_version`. Requires Terraform CLI 1.11+.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- `datahub_ingestion_source` data source: look up an existing ingestion source by
  `source_id`. Returns all resource attributes (`source_name`, `source_type`, `recipe`,
  schedule, executor, etc.) as read-only outputs.
- `datahub_remote_executor_pool` resource (DataHub Cloud only): create, update,
  and delete Remote Executor Pools. Supports `pool_id`, `description`, and
  `is_default`. Create waits for the pool to reach `READY` state before
  completing. Includes guards against deleting the embedded pool and a warning
  when deleting the current default pool.
- `datahub_remote_executor_pool` data source (DataHub Cloud only): look up an
  existing pool by `pool_id`, including the auto-provisioned `default` pool.
  Returns the pool's URN, `is_default`, `is_embedded`, `state_status`, and
  `channel` attributes.
- `examples/executor-pool-basic`: runnable example that provisions a pool and
  routes an ingestion source to it; includes copy-pasteable Helm values output.
- Availability badges (`DataHub ✅ | DataHub Cloud ✅` or `DataHub ❌ | DataHub Cloud ✅`)
  on every resource and data source schema description so users can see at a glance
  which surfaces require DataHub Cloud.

### Changed

- `examples/ingestion-source-csv-enricher`: updated comment on `remote_executor_id`
  to refer users to `datahub_remote_executor_pool` for custom-pool use cases.
- Provider index page (`docs/index.md`): rewritten description focusing on what the
  provider manages and what it does not; page title now renders as "DataHub Provider"
  (was "datahub Provider"); example usage updated to env-var-first pattern with a
  `datahub_me` credential validator.

### Fixed

- Internal 404 handling: replaced string-matching on `"not found"` in HTTP error
  bodies with an `ErrNotFound` sentinel value throughout the client layer. All
  resources and data sources now handle not-found consistently via `errors.Is`.

**API stability notice.** The GraphQL mutations backing `datahub_remote_executor_pool`
are classified as `internal` in DataHub Cloud and carry no external API stability
guarantee. See the resource documentation for details.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

Initial public release.

### Added

- `datahub_ingestion_source` resource: manage DataHub ingestion sources
  including schedule, executor, recipe, and platform configuration.
- `datahub_secret` resource: manage DataHub secrets with server-side
  AES-GCM-256 encryption. The `value` attribute is WriteOnly and never
  stored in Terraform state. Requires Terraform CLI 1.11+.
- `datahub_me` data source: read the authenticated principal's URN,
  username, display name, and email.
- Provider authentication via `gms_url`/`gms_token` block attributes,
  `DATAHUB_GMS_URL`/`DATAHUB_GMS_TOKEN` environment variables, or
  `~/.datahubenv` (DataHub CLI config).
